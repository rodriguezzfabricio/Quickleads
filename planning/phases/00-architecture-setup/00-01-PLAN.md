# 00-01 Plan - Schema Foundation

**Owner:** [JUNIOR-DEV]  
**Phase:** 0 - Architecture & Setup  
**Status:** Completed (2026-02-26)

## Scope

Implement the initial Supabase Postgres schema that establishes tenant-safe data boundaries and supports Phase 1-6 feature delivery.

## Files Touched

- `supabase/migrations/20260226_000001_init_schema.sql`

## Acceptance Criteria

- All required Phase 0 core tables are created.
- Key indexes are present for lead pipeline, follow-up scheduling, call logs, jobs, and sync performance.
- `sync_mutations` enforces unique idempotency by organization and client mutation id.
- Migration is structured for repeatable execution and explicit constraints.

## Security Checks

- RLS enabled and forced on all core tables.
- RLS policies scope access to authenticated organization membership.
- Organization owner-only controls exist for organization-level updates/deletes.
- No secrets or credentials appear in SQL.
