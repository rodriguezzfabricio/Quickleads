**Owner:** [JUNIOR-DEV]  
**Phase:** 0 - Architecture & Setup

## Scope

Document the Phase 0 security baseline and update execution state so Phase 1 can start from a verified backend foundation.

## Files Touched

- `planning/security/PHASE0_SECURITY_BASELINE.md`
- `planning/STATE.md`

## Acceptance Criteria

- Security baseline doc exists with mandatory controls and verification checklist.
- Phase 0 progress in `STATE.md` reflects completed backend setup items.
- Tooling blockers are explicit when required CLIs are unavailable.

## Security Checks

- Baseline includes no-secrets rule, RLS rule, and server input validation rule.
- Baseline documents auth-derived organization context requirement.
- Deferred security tasks are clearly tagged for upcoming phases.
