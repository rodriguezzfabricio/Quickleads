# 00-04 Plan - UX Parity Checklist

Owner: `[BIZ-COFOUNDER]`
Phase: `00 - Architecture & Setup`
Plan ID: `00-04`

## Objective

Deliver Phase 0 UX parity mapping and Flutter UI structure scaffolding so implementation phases can proceed without backend/security risk.

## Touched Files

- `planning/ux/SCREEN_PARITY_MATRIX.md`
- `planning/ux/INTERACTION_RULES.md`
- `planning/ux/CONTENT_TEMPLATES.md`
- `flutter_app/lib/features/home/home_screen.dart`
- `flutter_app/lib/features/leads/lead_capture_screen.dart`
- `flutter_app/lib/features/leads/lead_detail_screen.dart`
- `flutter_app/lib/features/jobs/job_detail_screen.dart`
- `flutter_app/lib/features/import/data_import_screen.dart`
- `flutter_app/lib/features/followups/followup_settings_screen.dart`
- `flutter_app/lib/features/projects/project_creation_screen.dart`
- `flutter_app/lib/features/clients/clients_screen.dart`
- `flutter_app/lib/features/clients/client_detail_screen.dart`
- `flutter_app/lib/app/router/app_router.dart`

## Checklist

- [x] Map every React reference screen to a Flutter destination path
- [x] Record parity status using `Not Started / Stubbed / Complete`
- [x] Define interaction and acceptance checks per mapped screen
- [x] Add requested Flutter presentation-only screen stubs
- [x] Wire router paths consistent with React flow
- [x] Keep placeholders clearly labeled by feature and phase

## Acceptance Criteria

- 100% of `src/app/screens/**` are represented in `SCREEN_PARITY_MATRIX.md`
- All requested Flutter scaffold files compile and route without backend dependencies
- Router includes parity routes for home, leads, clients, jobs, settings, onboarding, follow-up settings, daily sweep, and project creation flows
- No edits made to backend/security-critical paths

## Safety Guarantee

No backend changes were made in this plan.

- No edits under `supabase/**`
- No migration or function file changes
- No auth/network/storage logic added in Flutter scaffolds
