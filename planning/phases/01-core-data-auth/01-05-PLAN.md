# 01-05 Plan - Auth Cache and Settings Data Integrity

**Owner:** [JUNIOR-DEV]  
**Phase:** 1 - Core Data & Auth  
**Status:** Completed (2026-03-01)

## Scope

Harden auth-to-local hydration and clean settings data flow so authenticated sessions can reliably read/write organization/profile settings.

## Files Touched

- `flutter_app/lib/features/auth/providers/auth_provider.dart`
- `flutter_app/lib/core/storage/daos/organizations_dao.dart`
- `flutter_app/lib/features/settings/settings_screen.dart`
- `flutter_app/lib/core/storage/providers.dart`

## Acceptance Criteria

- Auth flow hydrates local org/profile cache after successful profile resolution.
- Settings screen no longer uses ad-hoc build-time data mutation helper extensions.
- Settings save messaging distinguishes local save vs cloud sync failure accurately.
- `flutter analyze` and `flutter test` remain clean after changes.
