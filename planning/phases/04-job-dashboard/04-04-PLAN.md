# 04-04 Plan - Jobs Semantic Normalization

**Owner:** [BIZ-COFOUNDER]  
**Phase:** 4 - Job Dashboard  
**Status:** Completed (2026-03-01)

## Scope

Normalize jobs phase/status labels and mappings to canonical domain enums across list/detail/create surfaces.

## Files Touched

- `flutter_app/lib/core/domain/job_phase.dart`
- `flutter_app/lib/core/domain/job_health_status.dart`
- `flutter_app/lib/shared/widgets/job_tile.dart`
- `flutter_app/lib/features/jobs/jobs_screen.dart`
- `flutter_app/lib/features/jobs/job_detail_screen.dart`
- `flutter_app/lib/features/projects/project_creation_screen.dart`

## Acceptance Criteria

- Legacy phase/status labels are removed from user-facing jobs surfaces.
- UI labels match canonical domain enums and DB values.
- Job health chips/filters consistently represent on-track, needs-attention, and behind-schedule states.
