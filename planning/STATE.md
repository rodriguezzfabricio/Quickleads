## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Phase 0: Use Supabase + Postgres + Edge Functions as MVP backend
- Phase 0: Use Riverpod + Drift + Supabase Flutter stack
- Phase 0: Use Twilio SMS + Resend email for follow-up messaging

### Pending Todos

- TODO(PHASE-1-runtime-tools): Install Flutter SDK to run native mobile commands in this environment.
- TODO(PHASE-1-runtime-tools): Install Supabase CLI to run local migrations/functions workflows.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Flutter SDK is not installed in this environment, so scaffold is file-structure-only for now
- Supabase CLI is not installed in this environment, so local migration/function execution cannot be verified here
